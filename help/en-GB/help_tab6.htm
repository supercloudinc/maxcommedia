<h3>Specific layouts for the mobile devices</h3>
<p>You can create specific layouts for the mobile devices here. Currently, iPhone, iPad and Android are supported. You can set width differently from the "normal" layout and create different layout of rows and module block for each of those devices.</p>
<p>Don't forget to enable iPhone, iPad and Android layout once you create it. If it's disabled, when you browse your site with the iPhone, iPad or Android, the "normal" layout will be used.</p>
